/**
 * Options to calculate a result aggregated on the operations of a class. ResultOptions allow us to return the sum, or
 * average, or the highest value of the metric computed on the operations of a class. They help to reduce the need for
 * custom implementations of those calculations in rules. Thus, they greatly reduce the amount of code required to
 * produce detailed violation reports for classes.
