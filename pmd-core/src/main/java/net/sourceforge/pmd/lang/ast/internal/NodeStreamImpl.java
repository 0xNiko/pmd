/**
 * Implementation of {@link NodeStream}.
 *
 * <p>Choosing to wrap a stream instead of extending the interface is to
 * allow the functions to return NodeStreams, and to avoid code the bloat
 * induced by delegation.
 *
 * <p>Intermediate operations like {@link #filter(Predicate)} or {@link #flatMap(Function)}
 * specify new pipeline operations that are stacked on the stream produced by
 * {@link #toStream()}. Terminal operations like {@link #count()} or {@link #toList()}
 * create a new temporary Stream with the correct pipeline and then apply the terminal
 * operation to it. That temporary stream is consumed, but subsequent terminal
 * operations on the NodeStream will be called on new Streams.
