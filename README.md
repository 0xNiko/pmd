**PMD** is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks,
unnecessary object creation, and so forth. It supports many languages. It can be extended with custom rules.
It uses JavaCC and Antlr for parsing source into AST and runs rules against it to find violations.
Rules can be written in Java or using a XPath query.

It supports Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce,
Modelica, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML, XSL, Scala.

Additionally it includes **CPD**, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in
C/C++, C#, Dart, Fortran, Go, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, JSP, Kotlin, Lua, Matlab, Modelica,
Objective-C, Perl, PHP, PLSQL, Python, Ruby, Salesforce.com Apex, Scala, Swift, Visualforce and XML.

In the future we hope to add support for data/control flow analysis and automatic (quick) fixes where
it makes sense.

## üöÄ Installation and Usage

Download the latest binary zip from the [releases](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases/latest)
and extract it somewhere.

Execute `bin/run.sh pmd` or `bin\pmd.bat`.

See also [Getting Started](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_installation.html)

**Demo:**

For this sample file:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class MyClass {
  void loop(List<String> l) {
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
      System.out.println(l.get(i));
    }
  }
}
```

Run PMD on the command line:

```bash
$ run.sh pmd -d /usr/src -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
