## Best Practices

{% include callout.html content="Rules which enforce generally accepted best practices." %}

*   [ProhibitedInterfaceBuilder](pmd_rules_swift_bestpractices.html#prohibitedinterfacebuilder): Creating views using Interface Builder should be avoided.
*   [UnavailableFunction](pmd_rules_swift_bestpractices.html#unavailablefunction): Unimplemented functions should be marked as unavailable.

## Error Prone

{% include callout.html content="Rules to detect constructs that are either broken, extremely confusing or prone to runtime errors." %}

*   [ForceCast](pmd_rules_swift_errorprone.html#forcecast): Force casts should be avoided.
*   [ForceTry](pmd_rules_swift_errorprone.html#forcetry): Force tries should be avoided.
