### New and noteworthy

### Fixed Issues

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

> Reminder: Please don't use members marked with the annotation {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}, as they will likely be removed, hidden, or otherwise intentionally broken with 7.0.0.


##### In ASTs

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the Java AST** (with other languages to come):

* Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and marked {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser, which for rules, means that never need to instantiate node themselves. Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
* **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. Version 7.0.0 will bring a new set of abstractions that will be public API, but the base classes are and will stay internal. You should not couple your code to them.
  * In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.JavaNode %} or  {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package, to refer to nodes generically.
  * Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
* Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**. We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.

Please look at {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.ast %} to find out the full list
of deprecations.
