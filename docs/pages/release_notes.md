### New and noteworthy

### Fixed Issues

*   apex-bestpractices
    *   [#2626](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2626): \[apex] UnusedLocalVariable - false positive on case insensitivity allowed in Apex
*   core
    *   [#724](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/724): \[core] Avoid parsing rulesets multiple times

### API Changes

*   XML rule definition in rulesets: In PMD 7, the `language` attribute will be required on all `rule`
    elements that declare a new rule. Some base rule classes set the language implicitly in their
    constructor, and so this is not required in all cases for the rule to work. But this
    behavior will be discontinued in PMD 7, so missing `language` attributes are now
    reported as a forward compatibility warning.
