### New and noteworthy

#### New rule designer documentation

The documentation for the rule designer is now available on the main PMD documentation page:
[Rule Designer Reference](pmd_userdocs_extending_designer_reference.html). Check it out to learn
about the usage and features of the rule designer.

### Fixed Issues

*   all
    *   [#1923](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1923): \[core] Incremental analysis does not work with shortnames
*   java-codestyle
    *   [#1951](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1951): \[java] UnnecessaryFullyQualifiedName rule triggered when variable name clashes with package name

### API Changes

#### Changes to Renderer

*   Each renderer has now a new method {% jdoc core::renderers.Renderer#setUseShortNames(List) %} which
    is used for implementing the "shortnames" CLI option. The method is automatically called by PMD, if this
    CLI option is in use. When rendering filenames to the report, the new helper method
    {% jdoc core::renderers.AbstractRenderer#determineFileName(String) %} should be used. This will change
    the filename to a short name, if the CLI option "shortnames" is used.
    
    Not adjusting custom renderers will make them render always the full file names and not honoring the
    CLI option "shortnames".

#### Deprecated APIs

##### For removal

*   The methods {% jdoc java::ast.ASTImportDeclaration#getImportedNameNode() %} and
    {% jdoc java::ast.ASTImportDeclaration#getPackage() %} have been deprecated and
    will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.
*   The method {% jdoc core::RuleContext#setSourceCodeFilename(String) %} has been deprecated
    and will be removed. The already existing method {% jdoc core::RuleContext#setSourceCodeFile(File)
    should be used instead. The method {% jdoc core::RuleContext#getSourceCodeFilename() %} still
    exists and returns just the filename without the full path.
*   The method {% jdoc core::processor.AbstractPMDProcessor#filenameFrom(DataSource) %} has been
    deprecated. It was used to determine a "short name" of the file being analyzed, so that the report
    can use short names. However, this logic has been moved to the renderers.
