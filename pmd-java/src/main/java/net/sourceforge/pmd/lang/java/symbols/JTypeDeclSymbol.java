     * its name, and the accessors of this class return default values.
     *
     * <p>This kind of symbol is introduced to allow for some best-effort
     * symbolic resolution. For example in:
     * <pre>{@code
     * import org.Bar;
     *
     * Bar foo = new Bar();
     * }</pre>
     * and supposing {@code org.Bar} is not on the classpath. The type
     * of {@code foo} is {@code Bar}, which we can qualify to {@code org.Bar} thanks to the
     * import (via symbol tables, and without even querying the classpath).
     * Even though we don't know what members {@code org.Bar} has, a
     * test for {@code typeIs("org.Bar")} would succeed with certainty,
     * so it makes sense to preserve the name information and not give
     * up too early.
     *
     * <p>Note that unresolved types are always created from an unresolved
     * <i>canonical name</i>, so they can't be just <i>any</i> type. For example,
     * they can't be array types, nor local classes (since those are lexically
     * scoped, so always resolvable), nor anonymous classes (can only be referenced
     * on their declaration site), type variables, etc.
