/**
 * Represents a named program element that can be referred to by simple name. Abstracts over
 * whether the declaration is in the analysed file or not, using reflection when it's not.
 *
 * <p>This type hierarchy is probably not directly relevant to users writing
 * rules. It's mostly intended to unify the representation of type resolution
 * and symbol analysis. At least for now it's internal.
 *
 * <p>SymbolDeclarations have no reference to the scope they were found in, because
 * that would tie the code reference to the analysed file, preventing the garbage
 * collection of scopes and nodes. This is a major difference with {@link NameDeclaration}.
 * The declaring scope would also vary from file to file. E.g.
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Foo {
 *     public int foo;
 *     // here the declaring scope of Foo#foo would be the class scope of this file
 * }
 *
 * class Bar extends Foo {
 *     // here the declaring scope of Foo#foo would be the inherited scope from Foo
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>By storing no reference, we ensure that code references can be shared across the
 * analysed project, allowing reflective resolution to be only done once.
