/**
 * A symbol table for a particular region of a Java program. Keeps track of the types,
 * values, and methods accessible from their simple name in their extent.
 *
 * <p>Each symbol table is linked to a parent table, and keeps track of a particular set
 * of declarations having the same relative precedence. When a symbol table is asked for
 * the meaning of a name in a particular syntactic context (type name, method name, value name),
 * it first determines if it tracks a declaration with a matching name.
 * <ul>
 *      <li>If there is one, it returns the {@link JElementSymbol} representing the entity
 *          the name stands for in the given context;
 *      <li>If there is none, it asks the same question to its parent table recursively
 *          and returns that result.
 * </ul>
 * This allows directly encoding shadowing and hiding mechanisms in the parent-child
 * relationships.
 *
 * <h2>Terminology</h3>
 *
 * <p> If a symbol table S directly "knows about" a declaration D, then D is said
 * to be <i>tracked</i> by S. A symbol table doesn't track the declarations tracked
 * by its parents.
 *
 * <p>Each symbol table is only relevant to a set of program points, which it is said
 * to <i>dominate</i>. The set of program points a table dominates is referred-to
 * as the <i>scope</i> of that symbol table. The scope of a symbol table is a subset of
 * the scope of its parent. The declarations tracked by a symbol table S are said to be
 * <i>in-scope</i> throughout the scope of S, which means they are accessible from their
 * simple name.
 *
 * <h3>Correspondence with JLS terminology</h4>
 *
 * <p>The JLS doesn't care about symbol table implementations so the above terminology is
 * not standard spec. The JLS only defines the <i>scope of a declaration</i>:
 *
 * <blockquote cite="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.3">
 *     The scope of a declaration is the region of the program within which
 *     the entity declared by the declaration can be referred to using a
 *     simple name, provided it is not shadowed.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>For our purposes, a symbol table tracks a set of declarations having exactly the same
 * jls:scope, so that the pmd:scope of a symbol table is the jls:scope of any of its tracked
 * declarations.
