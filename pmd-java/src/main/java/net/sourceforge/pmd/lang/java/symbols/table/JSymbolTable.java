/**
 * A symbol table for a particular region of a Java program. Keeps track of the types,
 * values, and methods accessible from their simple name in their extent.
 *
 * <p>Each symbol table is linked to a parent table, and keeps track of a particular set
 * of declarations having the same relative precedence. When a symbol table is asked for
 * the meaning of a name in a particular syntactic context (type name, method name, value name),
 * it first determines if it tracks a declaration with a matching name.
 * <ul>
 *      <li>If there is one, it returns the {@link JDeclarationSymbol} representing the entity
 *          the name stands for in the given context;
 *      <li>If there is none, it asks the same question to its parent table recursively
 *          and returns that result.
 * </ul>
 * This allows directly encoding shadowing and hiding mechanisms in the parent-child
 * relationships.
 *
 * <h2>Why not keep the current symbol table</h2>
 *
 * <p>The current symbol table framework was not built with the same goals in mind.
 * It indexes the AST to reduce it to a simpler representation, which is mostly
 * shortcuts to nodes. That representation hasn't proved very useful in rules,
 * which mostly only use it to resolve variable accesses.
 *
 * <p>The biggest issue is that it was not designed to abstract over whether we
 * have a node to represent a declaration or not. It can't work on reflection
 * data, and thus cannot really help type resolution, even if a good symbol table
 * would take the burden of resolving references off a type checker. The
 * shortcomings of the current symbol table make the current typeres duplicate
 * logic, and ultimately perform tasks that are not its responsibility,
 * which is probably why {@link ClassTypeResolver} is so huge and nasty.
 *
 * <p>Having an abstraction layer to unify them allows the AST analyses to
 * be complementary, and rely on each other, instead of being so self-reliant.
 * The abstraction provided by {@link JDeclarationSymbol} may in the future be used
 * to build global indices of analysed projects to implement multifile analysis.
 *
 * <p>The goals of this rewrite should be:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>To make our language analyses passes share information and be complementary
 *      <li>To have a symbol table that is precise and exhaustive enough that all rules can depend on it
 *      <li>To modularize the system so that it's more easily testable and documentable
 * </ul>
